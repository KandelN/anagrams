## Anagram Solver using Python
This is my first mini project in python. I did this as a challege problem. There are two independent working versions of the file. Version 0.1 had been programmed when i have learned very basic syntax of python and did not have much exposure into the language and programming techniques. Whereas, Version 1 had been programmed after more than one month of dedicated learing and practice of python as a programming language. You can clearly see that, among two approaches, first one is more novice approach with very large computational time complexity for longer words while second approach is more robust in terms of time and space complexity.
